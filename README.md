# Chatbots

A chatbot is basically an artificial intelligence software that can simulate a conversation(more appropriately a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites,mobile apps or through the telephone.

Why are they important:
A chatbot is can say one of the most advanced and promising tech for efficient interaction between humans and machines so as to releive humans from tiresome work.Chatbot applications basically streamlines interactions between people and services,enhancing customer experience.They offer companies new opportunities to improve their customers engagement process.

Types of chatbots:
1)Retrieval base chatbots:
 Retrieval based basically works on the principle of directed flows or graphs.The bot is basically trained to rank the best response from a finite set of predefined responses. The responses here are entered manually(or provided from some source),or based on a knowledge base of pre-existing information.
2)Generative Chatbots
 The other type of chatbots are built using generative model. These chatbots are not built with predefined responses. Instead, they are trained using a large number of previous conversations, based upon which responses to the user are generated. They  really requires a very large amount of conversational data to train them on it so that upon a input received they can give some
 great response(if trained properly on huge data).
